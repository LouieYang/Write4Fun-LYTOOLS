## cluster_isodata.py
***An unsupervised function to cluster data without pre-defining cluster numbers***

Three Gaussian-distributed class data sampled from (3, 2), (-1, 1), (0, -1) with different standard deviations, each of which contains 100 samples. Set initial class number to 1 and expected class number to 4, and isodata algorithm finds the true class number 3.
