## cluster_isodata.py
***An unsupervised function to cluster data without pre-defining cluster numbers***

Example samples three Gaussian-distributed class data on (3, 2), (-1, 1), (0, -1) with different standard deviations, each of which contains 100 samples. The initial class number is 1 and expected class number is 4, and the isodata algorithm finally reaches the true number 3.
